# Covid-19 Dataset Analysis

### Project Overview
I have created a COVID-19 Dataset Analysis Dashboard on Power BI that shows the detailed attrition analysis of COVID-19 situations. A short insight into a COVID-19 dataset analysis Power BI visualization report (KPI) centered around Cards visualizing Total Deaths, New Cases, and Total Cases.
  
## The key learnings from this project include:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Processing
- Data Visualization

#### Total Deaths:
A dedicated card visualizes the total number of deaths, offering a stark representation of the human impact of the pandemic.

#### New Cases:
This card displays the number of new cases, providing insights into the ongoing spread and potential areas of concern.

#### Total Cases:
The card showcases the cumulative total of confirmed COVID-19 cases, offering a comprehensive view of the overall infection rate.

#### Line Chart: 
The report leverages a dynamic Line Chart to illustrate the progression of Total Cases over time, providing a granular view of the COVID-19 impact across continents and countries.

The report employs a Line Chart to present a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 impact, highlighting the evolution of Total Cases over the years across different countries.

The report utilizes a Line Chart to depict the variation in Median Age across continents and countries, offering insights into the demographic dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic.
